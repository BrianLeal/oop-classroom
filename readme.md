# OOP Classroom

This project will require you to build classes for objects you might find in a Galvanize classroom! You will build five classes:

* Computer
* Desk
* Marker
* Room
* Student

The tests best describe what properties and methods to build for each.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
1. Run the tests with `npm test`
1. After you complete the Computer class's tests, go into the test/ folder and remove the 'x' before the word 'describe' near the top of the desk.test.js file.  This will make the Desk class's tests run - they will no longer appear as 'pending' in your terminal and will either fail or pass.
1. After the Desk class's tests are all passing, go into the test/ folder and remove the 'x' before the 'describe' in marker.test.js...
1. And so on (and so forth), until all tests are passing and no longer pending!
